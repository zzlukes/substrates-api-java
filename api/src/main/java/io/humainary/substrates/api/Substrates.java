/// The Substrates API is Humainary's core runtime for deterministic emissions, adaptive control,
/// and mirrored state coordination. Circuits, conduits, channels, pipes, subscribers, subjects,
/// and scopes compose into a nanosecond-latency fabric for observability, adaptability,
/// controllability, and operability workloads.
///
/// Substrates enables building **neural-like computational networks** where values flow through
/// circuits, conduits, and channels in deterministic order, with dynamic subscription-based
/// wiring that adapts to runtime topology without stopping the system.
///
///
/// ## Architecture Overview
///
/// **Data Flow Path**:
///
/// 1. **Circuit** creates **Conduit**
/// 2. **Conduit** creates **Channel** (lazily, on first access by name)
/// 3. **Channel** exposes **Pipe** for emissions
/// 4. **Subscriber** attaches **Pipe** to channel via **Registrar**
/// 5. Emissions flow: `Channel → Flow → Subscriber Pipes` (on circuit thread)
///
/// **Key Insight**: Channels are discovered dynamically by subscribers, enabling adaptive
/// topologies that respond to runtime structure without prior knowledge of channel names.
///
/// ## Threading Model (Foundational)
///
/// **Single-threaded circuit execution** is the foundation of Substrates' design:
///
/// - Every circuit owns exactly **one processing thread** (virtual thread)
/// - All emissions, flows, and subscriber callbacks execute **exclusively on that thread**
/// - **Deterministic ordering**: Emissions observed in the order they were enqueued
/// - **No synchronization needed**: State touched only from circuit thread requires no locks
/// - **Sequential execution**: Only one operation executes at a time per circuit
///
/// **Caller vs Circuit Thread**:
///
/// - **Caller threads** (your code): Enqueue emissions, return immediately
/// - **Circuit thread** (executor): Dequeue and process emissions sequentially
/// - **Performance principle**: Balance work between caller (before enqueue) and circuit
///   (after dequeue). The circuit thread is the bottleneck - shift work to callers when possible.
///
/// This model enables:
/// - low-latency emissions
/// - Elimination of race conditions and synchronization overhead
/// - Deterministic replay and digital twin synchronization
/// - Safe cyclic topologies (neural-like recurrent networks)
///
/// ## Core Guarantees
///
/// **Deterministic Ordering**:
/// - Emissions are observed in strict enqueue order
/// - Earlier emissions complete before later ones begin
/// - All subscribers see emissions in the same order
///
/// **Eventual Consistency**:
/// - Subscription changes (add/remove) use **lazy rebuild** with version tracking
/// - Channels detect changes on next emission (not immediately)
/// - No blocking or global coordination required
/// - Lock-free operation with minimal overhead
///
/// **State Isolation**:
/// - Flow operators maintain independent state per channel
/// - Subscriber state accessed only from circuit thread (no sync needed)
/// - No shared mutable state between circuits
///
/// ## Performance Profile
///
/// The Substrates API is designed for **extreme performance** to enable neural-like network exploration,
/// achieving ~2.98ns emission latency (≈336M ops/sec). This performance enables:
/// - Billions of emissions through cyclic networks
/// - Real-time adaptive topologies
/// - Spiking neural network implementations
/// - Massive parallelism via multiple circuits with virtual threads
///
/// **Performance best practices**:
/// - Keep flow pipelines short (each stage adds overhead)
/// - Avoid I/O and blocking in subscriber callbacks
/// - Prefer stateless flow operators over stateful when possible
///
/// ## Runtime Pillars
///
/// - **[Circuit]**: Single-threaded execution engine that drains emissions deterministically.
///     Provides `await()` for external coordination and guarantees memory visibility.
///
/// - **[Conduit]**: Pooled percept factory that creates domain-specific wrappers around channels.
///     Routes emissions through flow pipelines to registered subscribers.
///
/// - **[Channel]**: Subject-backed emission port owned by a conduit. Channels pool by name
///     ensuring stable routing and identity guarantees.
///
/// - **[Pipe]**: Emission carrier abstraction that routes typed values through flows.
///     Create receptor pipes via [Cortex#pipe(Receptor)] or transformed pipes via [Cortex#pipe(Function, Pipe)].
///
/// - **[Subscriber]**: Callback interface invoked lazily on first emission to channels. Dynamically attaches
///     pipes to channels, enabling adaptive topologies.
///
/// - **[Subscription]**: Lifecycle handle for canceling subscriber interest. Unregisters
///     pipes from channels via lazy rebuild on next emission.
///
/// - **[Source]**: Event source managing subscription model. Connects subscribers to channels
///     with lazy rebuild synchronization.
///
/// - **[Flow]**: Configurable processing pipeline for data transformation. Operators include
///     diff, guard, limit, sample, sift, reduce, replace, peek.
///
/// - **[Subject]**: Hierarchical identity system with unique ID, name, and state. Every
///     substrate component has a subject for precision targeting.
///
/// - **[Scope]**: Structured resource manager that auto-closes registered assets in reverse
///     order, enabling RAII-like lifetime control.
///
/// - **[Registrar]**: Temporary handle for attaching pipes during subscriber callbacks.
///     **Only valid during the callback** - temporal contract.
///
/// ## Design Philosophy
///
/// The Substrates API is built around three principles:
///
/// 1. **Determinism over throughput**: Predictable ordering enables replay, testing, digital twins
/// 2. **Composition over inheritance**: Small interfaces compose into complex behaviors
/// 3. **Explicitness over magic**: No hidden frameworks, clear data flow, no reflection-based wiring
///
/// The API is designed for **exploration of neural-like computational networks** where:
/// - Circuits act as processing nodes with different timescales
/// - Channels emit signals through dynamic connections
/// - Subscribers rewire topology in response to runtime structure
/// - Flow operators create temporal dynamics (diff, sample, limit)
///
/// This enables emergent computation from substrate primitives with deterministic behavior
/// suitable for production systems.
///
/// ## Practical Applications
///
/// Substrates powers:
///
/// - **Observability & Instrumentation**: Nanosecond-latency telemetry pipelines capturing
///   metrics, traces, and logs without impacting application performance
///
/// - **Adaptive Service Control**: Closed-loop automation adjusting to runtime conditions with
///   deterministic state machines and feedback loops
///
/// - **Digital Twin Synchronization**: Mirrored state coordination with deterministic replay
///   for simulation, testing, and what-if analysis
///
/// - **Operational Safety Systems**: Predictable teardown and composable lifetimes via Scope
///   for systems demanding graceful degradation
///
/// - **Neural Network Experimentation**: Substrate primitives compose into spiking networks,
///   recurrent topologies, and adaptive learning systems
///
/// ## When to Use Substrates
///
/// **Good fit**:
/// - High-frequency event processing (millions+ events/sec)
/// - Deterministic ordering required (replay, testing, digital twins)
/// - Dynamic topology adaptation (auto-wiring, runtime discovery)
/// - Low-latency requirements (sub-microsecond overhead)
/// - Cyclic data flow (feedback loops, recurrent networks)
///
/// **Not a good fit**:
/// - Simple request/response patterns (use standard frameworks)
/// - Heavy I/O-bound workloads (circuit thread blocks)
/// - Distributed consensus (single-circuit design, use external coordination)
/// - Trivial transformations (overhead not justified)
///
/// ## Provider Bootstrapping
///
/// The Substrates framework uses a two-tier discovery mechanism to locate and load the
/// implementation provider at runtime:
///
/// 1. **System Property (Primary)**: Set the system property `io.humainary.substrates.spi.provider`
///    to the fully qualified class name of your provider implementation. The class must extend
///    [io.humainary.substrates.spi.CortexProvider] and have a public no-arg constructor.
///
/// 2. **ServiceLoader (Fallback)**: If no system property is set, provider discovery falls back
///    to Java's [ServiceLoader] mechanism. Create a file at
///    `META-INF/services/io.humainary.substrates.spi.CortexProvider` containing the
///    fully qualified class name of your provider implementation.
///
/// The provider is loaded lazily on the first call to [#cortex()] using the initialization-on-demand
/// holder idiom, ensuring thread-safe singleton initialization without synchronization overhead.
///
/// See [io.humainary.substrates.spi.CortexProvider] for implementation details.
///
/// ## Entry Points
///
/// - **[Cortex#circuit()]**: Create a circuit to begin
/// - **[Circuit#conduit(Composer)]**: Create domain-specific percepts
/// - **[Lookup#percept(Name)]**: Obtain percepts by name
/// - **[Channel#pipe()]**: Get pipe for emissions
/// - **[Source#subscribe(Subscriber)]**: Dynamically discover channels

  /// A capture of an emitted value from a channel with its associated subject.
  ///
  /// Captures are produced by [Reservoir]s, which subscribe to sources and record emissions
  /// along with the channel subject that produced them. Each capture pairs:
  /// - The emitted value (of type E)
  /// - The channel's subject that emitted it
  ///
  /// This allows inspection of both what was emitted and where it came from, which is

  /// ## Memory Considerations
  ///
  /// Reservoirs buffer captures in memory. For long-running scenarios:

  /// A hierarchical computational unit supporting arbitrarily deep nested structures.
  ///
  /// Cell combines four capabilities to enable complex hierarchical data flow:
  /// - **[Pipe]**: Receives typed input emissions
  /// - **[Lookup]**: Creates and caches child cells by name
  /// - **[Source]**: Emits child outputs for observation
  /// - **[Extent]**: Provides iteration over child cells
  ///
  /// ## Architecture
  ///
  /// Each cell has:
  /// - **Transformer**: Converts output pipe to input pipe (defines cell's processing)
  /// - **Aggregator**: Transforms output before routing upward
  /// - **Hub**: Internal channel system for child emission routing
  /// - **Outlet**: External pipe receiving aggregated outputs
  ///
  /// ## Data Flow
  ///
  /// **Downward (input to cell)**:
  /// 1. `cell.pipe().emit(input)` called by external code
  /// 2. Input flows through ingress to inlet
  /// 3. Ingress determines how input reaches children
  ///
  /// **Upward (child to parent)**:
  /// 1. Child emits to its outlet
  /// 2. Outlet pipes to parent hub's channel
  /// 3. Hub subscription forwards to parent outlet (async dispatch)
  /// 4. Parent outlet flows to grandparent hub, etc.
  ///
  /// **Key insight**: Upward flow uses hub subscriptions rather than direct pipes,
  /// enabling **stack-safe arbitrarily deep hierarchies** by breaking synchronous call chains.
  ///
  /// Subscriptions observe what's happening within child cells but don't interfere
  /// with the primary upward data flow to the outlet.
  ///
  /// ## Stack Safety
  ///
  /// Unlike direct pipe chains, cells use async dispatch through hub subscriptions:
  /// - Direct pipes: `child → parent → grandparent` (synchronous, stack depth limited)
  /// - Cell hubs: `child → [circuit queue] → parent → [circuit queue] → grandparent` (async, unlimited depth)
  ///
  /// This enables deep hierarchies (100+ levels) without stack overflow, essential for
  /// neural-like networks and deep computational graphs.
  ///
  /// ## Threading Model
  ///
  /// All cell operations execute on the owning circuit's thread:
  /// - Child creation happens on circuit thread
  /// - Upward emission routing happens on circuit thread
  /// - Subscriber callbacks happen on circuit thread
  ///
  /// However, `cell.pipe().emit()` can be called from any thread - emissions are enqueued
  /// and processed on the circuit thread.
  ///
  /// ## Use Cases
  ///
  /// Cells excel at:
  /// - **Deep computational hierarchies**: Multi-level processing without stack overflow
  /// - **Tree-structured data flow**: Hierarchical aggregation and distribution
  /// - **Neural network topologies**: Deep networks with recurrent connections
  /// - **Organizational structures**: Modeling hierarchies with upward reporting
  /// - **Compositional computation**: Building complex behavior from simple primitives

  /// ## Temporal Contract
  ///
  /// **IMPORTANT**: Channels follow a temporal contract - they are only valid during

  /// Always call [#pipe()] within the composer callback and store/use the returned pipe.
  ///
  /// ## Pooling and Identity
  ///
  /// Channels are pooled by name within a conduit. **Channels with the same name are
  /// identical objects** - repeated requests with the same name return the same channel
  /// instance internally.

  /// A computational network of conduits, cells, channels, and pipes.
  /// Circuit serves as the central processing engine that manages data flow across
  /// the system, providing precise ordering guarantees for emitted events and
  /// coordinating the interaction between various components.
  ///
  /// Circuits can create and manage conduits and cells, allowing for
  /// complex event processing pipelines to be constructed and maintained.
  ///
  /// ## Terminology: Inlet and Outlet Roles
  ///
  /// **All pipes are consumers** (implementing the [Pipe] interface with `emit()`).
  /// The terms **"inlet"** and **"outlet"** describe **roles that pipes play relative
  /// to the circuit boundary**, not distinct types:
  ///
  /// - **Inlet role**: Pipes on the ingress side receiving external data into the circuit
  ///   (e.g., percepts created by [Composer], channel pipes)
  /// - **Outlet role**: Pipes on the egress side receiving processed data from the circuit
  ///   (e.g., subscriber pipes, cell egress)
  ///
  /// In documentation, "inlet" and "outlet" refer to these contextual roles, not
  /// separate interfaces or types. A pipe's role is determined by its position in
  /// the data flow topology.
  ///
  /// ## Threading and Execution Model
  ///
  /// Circuits guarantee that every emission is processed on a single execution thread owned
  /// by the circuit. Callers may emit from any thread, but observable effects always occur
  /// on that circuit thread. Implementations must provide:
  ///
  /// - **Deterministic ordering**: Emissions are observed in the order they were accepted
  ///       by the circuit. This guarantee is absolute - earlier emissions complete before
  ///       later ones begin execution.
  /// - **Circuit-thread confinement**: State touched only from the circuit thread requires
  ///       no additional synchronization. The circuit thread is the sole accessor of circuit-confined state.
  /// - **Bounded enqueue**: Caller threads do not execute circuit work but may briefly
  ///       coordinate with the circuit while enqueueing work; implementations must keep this
  ///       path short and responsive under contention
  /// - **Sequential execution**: Only one emission executes at a time per circuit. No
  ///       concurrent execution occurs within a single circuit.
  /// - **Memory visibility**: The circuit thread guarantees visibility of all state updates
  ///       made during emission processing. Coordination with external threads requires
  ///       explicit barriers via [#await()].
  ///
  /// ## Cascading Emission Ordering (Dual Queue Model)
  ///
  /// Circuits use **two queues** to manage emissions with deterministic priority ordering:
  ///
  /// - **Ingress queue**: Shared queue for emissions from external threads (caller-side)
  /// - **Transit queue**: Local queue for emissions originating from circuit thread during processing
  ///
  /// When processing an emission from the ingress queue triggers additional emissions from within
  /// the circuit thread, those cascading emissions are added to the **transit queue**, which has
  /// **priority** over the ingress queue:
  ///
  /// **Key characteristics**:
  /// - **No call stack recursion**: All emissions enqueue rather than invoke nested calls
  /// - **Stack safe**: Even deeply cascading chains don't overflow the stack
  /// - **Priority processing**: Transit queue drains completely before returning to ingress queue
  /// - **Causality preservation**: Cascading effects complete before processing next external input
  /// - **Atomic computations**: Cascading chains appear atomic to external observers
  /// - **Neural-like dynamics**: Enables proper signal propagation in feedback networks
  ///
  /// When processing transit work that itself emits, those emissions are added to the **back of
  /// the transit queue** (not recursively invoked), maintaining the iterative queue-based model.
  ///
  /// ## Performance Expectations
  ///
  /// The API is designed for ultra-low-latency emission paths. Implementations should minimize
  /// overhead on the caller side and avoid heavy computation on the circuit thread so the queue
  /// continues to drain predictably. The circuit thread is the performance bottleneck - balance
  /// work between caller threads (emission side) and the circuit thread (processing side).

    /// 2. Signaling the processing thread to terminate

    /// 4. Releasing conduits and their channels
    ///

    ///
    /// This method is **non-blocking** - it marks the circuit for closure and returns
    /// immediately. The processing thread drains the queue and terminates asynchronously.
    /// Use [#await()] before close() to ensure all pending work completes:

    /// - New emissions may be rejected (implementation-specific)

    /// - Repeated close() calls are safe (idempotent)

    /// ## Asynchronous Dispatch
    ///
    /// Each emission requires one enqueue operation and one circuit-thread execution:

    /// custom operators.
    ///
    /// These approaches complement rather than compete. Use [Cortex#pipe(Function, Pipe)] for type
    /// conversions and transformations; use Flow for filtering, deduplication,
    /// and stateful operations within the same type.
    ///
    /// Threading note: Flow operations execute on the circuit's worker thread, providing

  /// A factory for pooled percepts that emit events through named channels.
  ///
  /// Conduit combines three capabilities:
  /// - **Lookup**: Creates and caches percept instances by name
  /// - **Source**: Emits events and allows subscription to channel creation
  ///
  /// Conduits serve as the primary mechanism for creating domain-specific emission
  /// abstractions (sensors, monitors, probes) that route values through the circuit's
  /// processing engine.
  ///
  /// ## Percept Pattern
  ///
  /// A conduit creates a **percept** (P) by transforming each [Channel] via the composer function: `Channel<E> → P`.
  /// Common patterns: identity (return channel's pipe), wrapper (percept wraps pipe), or facade (custom API wrapping pipe).
  ///
  /// ## Lookup Semantics (via Lookup)
  ///
  /// Conduits provide name-based percept lookup with caching:
  /// - [Lookup#percept(Name)] retrieves or creates percept for the given name
  /// - [Lookup#percept(Subject)] convenience method extracts name from subject
  /// - [Lookup#percept(Substrate)] convenience method extracts name from substrate
  /// - Same name always returns the same percept instance (cached)
  /// - Different names create different percepts with separate channels
  /// - Each percept has its own unique channel and subject
  ///
  /// **Identity guarantee**: Percepts with the same name are identical objects.
  ///
  /// Lookup enables efficient reuse - calling `conduit.percept(name)` multiple
  /// times returns the cached instance, avoiding repeated allocations. This identity
  /// guarantee also ensures stable routing - all emissions for a given percept name
  /// flow through the same channel to the same subscribers.
  ///
  /// ## Lazy Subscriber Callbacks (via Source)
  ///
  /// Subscriber callbacks are invoked lazily during emission processing:
  /// - First call to [Lookup#percept(Name)] creates new channel (no callbacks invoked)
  /// - First emission to that channel triggers rebuild on circuit thread
  /// - During rebuild, subscriber callback is invoked for newly encountered channels
  /// - Subscriber receives [Subject] of the channel and [Registrar] to attach pipes
  /// - No events of type `E` are emitted - callback provides registration mechanism
  ///
  /// This lazy callback model enables dynamic discovery - subscribers can attach pipes
  /// to channels on-demand without knowing channel names in advance, and without overhead
  /// until emissions actually occur.
  ///
  /// **Thread safety**: Subscriber callbacks always execute on the circuit thread,
  /// providing single-threaded guarantees. This means callbacks can safely use mutable
  /// state, access shared data structures, and perform stateful operations without any
  /// synchronization, locks, or atomic operations.
  ///
  /// ## Subscription Model (via Source)
  ///
  /// Subscribe to be notified of channels when they receive their first emission:
  ///
  /// ## Threading Model
  ///
  /// Conduit operations are split between caller thread and circuit thread:
  ///
  /// **Caller thread** (synchronous):
  /// - [Lookup#percept(Name)] creates and caches channels immediately (thread-safe)
  /// - `subscribe(subscriber)` enqueues registration to circuit thread
  ///
  /// **Circuit thread** (asynchronous):
  /// - Subscriber registration completes and increments version
  /// - Emissions trigger lazy rebuild when version mismatch detected
  /// - Rebuild invokes subscriber callbacks for newly encountered channels
  /// - Emissions dispatched to registered pipes
  ///
  /// This model allows [Lookup#percept(Name)] to be called from any thread without blocking,
  /// while ensuring all subscriber callbacks execute single-threaded on the circuit.
  ///
  /// ## Lifecycle
  ///
  /// Conduits are created via [Circuit#conduit(Composer)]:
  /// 1. **Created**: Circuit creates conduit with composer function
  /// 2. **Active**: Percepts created on-demand via `percept()`
  /// 3. **Closed**: When circuit closes, conduit is also closed
  ///
  /// Conduits inherit the circuit's lifecycle - when the circuit closes, all conduits
  /// close automatically.
  ///
  /// ## Use Cases
  ///
  /// Conduits excel at:
  /// - **Domain modeling**: Create typed abstractions (Sensor, Monitor, Metric)
  /// - **Name-based routing**: Cache instances by logical names
  /// - **Dynamic discovery**: Subscribe to new channels as they're created
  /// - **API hiding**: Provide domain API while hiding raw channels
  /// - **Instrumentation**: Automatically attach observers to all channels

  /// Represents the execution context from which substrate operations originate.
  ///
  /// A [Current] identifies the execution context (thread, coroutine, fiber, etc.)

  /// a manner analogous to `Thread.currentThread()` in Java:
  ///
  /// ```java
  /// var current = cortex.current ();
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Temporal Contract
  ///
  /// **IMPORTANT**: Current follows a temporal contract - it is only valid within the
  /// execution context (thread) that obtained it. The Current reference represents the
  /// **thread-local execution state** and **must not be retained** or used from a different
  /// thread or execution context.
  ///
  /// Like `Thread.currentThread()`, Current is intrinsically tied to its originating context.
  /// Using it from another thread leads to incorrect behavior. Always call [Cortex#current()]
  /// from the context where you need the current execution reference.
  ///
  /// Violating this contract by storing Current references and accessing them from different
  /// threads or after the execution context has changed leads to undefined behavior.
  ///
  /// ## Subject Identity
  ///
  /// As a [Substrate], Current provides access to its underlying [Subject] which includes:
  ///
  /// - **Identity** via [Subject#id()] - unique identifier for this execution context
  /// - **Hierarchical naming** via [Subject#name()] - derived from the thread or context type
  /// - **Context properties** via [Subject#state()] - metadata about the execution context
  ///
  /// ## Use Cases
  ///
  /// - **Correlation**: Link emissions and operations back to their originating context
  /// - **Tracing**: Track execution flow across substrate boundaries
  /// - **Diagnostics**: Identify which contexts are invoking substrate operations
  ///
  /// ## Language Mapping
  ///
  /// The abstraction is language-agnostic and maps to platform-specific concepts:
  ///
  /// - **Java**: Platform/virtual threads
  /// - **Go**: Goroutines
  /// - **Kotlin**: Coroutines
  /// - **Other**: Implementation-specific concurrency primitives

  /// Represents a configurable processing pipeline for data transformation.
  ///
  /// Flow operations create a chain of transformations that run between a channel and
  /// the subscribers attached to that channel. Flows are configured via method chaining,
  /// with each operator returning a new Flow representing the extended pipeline.
  ///
  /// ## Execution Context
  ///
  /// Every flow stage executes on the circuit thread that owns the conduit. Emissions are
  /// processed sequentially, so each stage observes values in deterministic order.
  ///
  /// **Circuit-thread execution guarantee**: All flow operations execute exclusively on the
  /// circuit thread. This means:
  ///
  /// - Flow operators execute sequentially for each emission
  /// - No concurrent execution of flow stages for a given channel
  /// - State within flow operators requires no synchronization
  /// - Deterministic ordering of emissions through the pipeline
  ///
  /// **User-provided functions**: All functions, predicates, pipes, and operators passed to
  /// Flow methods (e.g., `guard(Predicate)`, `replace(Function)`, `peek(Consumer)`) will be
  /// executed on the circuit's processing thread:
  ///
  /// - **Thread-safe execution** - No concurrent invocation of your lambdas/functions
  /// - **Sequential processing** - Each emission processes through your functions one at a time
  /// - **No synchronization needed** - For local state within the function
  ///
  /// **CRITICAL - External state access**: While your functions execute thread-safely on the
  /// circuit thread, **you must ensure thread-safe access to any external shared mutable state**
  /// they reference. If your functions access fields, collections, or other state shared across
  /// threads, you are responsible for proper synchronization.
  ///
  /// ## State Management
  ///
  /// Flow operators fall into two categories based on state requirements:
  ///
  /// **Stateful operators** (maintain internal state across emissions):
  /// - **diff()**: Tracks last emitted value for duplicate detection
  /// - **guard(Object, BiPredicate)**: Tracks last value for comparison
  /// - **limit()**: Counts emissions to enforce limit
  /// - **reduce()**: Maintains accumulator state
  /// - **sample()**: Counts emissions for interval-based sampling
  /// - **sift()**: Maintains complex filtering state
  ///
  /// **Stateless operators** (process each emission independently):
  /// - **forward()**: Tees emissions to side channel
  /// - **guard(Predicate)**: Evaluates predicate without state
  /// - **peek()**: Observes emissions without modification
  /// - **replace()**: Transforms each value independently
  ///
  /// Stateful operators store mutable state without external synchronization since they
  /// execute exclusively on the circuit thread. Each flow maintains its own state instance,
  /// isolated from other flows.
  ///
  /// **State isolation guarantee**: Flow state is private to the flow instance. Multiple
  /// channels with separate flow configurations maintain independent state. Two channels
  /// with the same flow configuration (e.g., both using `diff()`) maintain separate state
  /// instances - changes in one channel's state do not affect the other.
  ///
  /// ## Composition and Chaining
  ///
  /// Flow operations are **composable** via method chaining:
  ///
  /// Each method returns a new Flow instance representing the pipeline extended with
  /// that operator. The order of operators matters - they execute left-to-right in
  /// the order chained.
  ///
  /// **Builder pattern**: Flow uses the builder pattern (fluent interface) for pipeline
  /// construction. Most methods return `this` or a new Flow instance, allowing continued
  /// chaining.
  ///
  /// ## Operator Ordering
  ///
  /// The order of flow operators affects both **correctness** and **performance**:
  ///
  /// **Correctness**: Some operator orders change semantics:
  ///
  /// **Performance**: Place cheap filters early to reduce downstream work:
  ///
  /// ## Performance Guidance
  ///
  /// Flow pipelines run on the circuit thread and therefore contribute directly to emission
  /// latency. Keep pipelines concise, avoid expensive computations, and prefer pre-processing on
  /// the caller thread (for example via [Cortex#pipe(Function, Pipe)]) when additional work is
  /// required before dispatch.
  ///
  /// **Performance tips**:
  ///
  /// - Use [Cortex#pipe(Function, Pipe)] to shift work from circuit thread to caller thread
  /// - Avoid allocations in flow operators (especially in hot paths)
  /// - Keep flow pipelines short - each stage adds overhead
  /// - Stateful operators (diff, guard, reduce) are more expensive than stateless (replace, peek)
  /// - Place cheap filters early to reduce downstream processing
  /// - Consider batching or buffering for expensive operations
  ///
  /// ## Lifecycle and Builder Pattern
  ///
  /// Flow instances follow a **builder-like pattern** for pipeline configuration:
  /// - Methods support fluent chaining via `@Fluent` returning Flow instances
  /// - Configuration builds up a pipeline of transformation stages
  /// - The Flow is materialized into an actual pipe chain when passed to downstream components
  /// - Execution state (for stateful operators) is created during materialization,
  ///   not during Flow configuration
  ///
  /// **Implementation note**: Flow instances may be mutable builders (accumulating
  /// pipeline stages) or immutable functional builders (returning new instances).
  /// The interface does not guarantee either approach - implementations are free
  /// to optimize as needed.
  ///
  /// **Thread safety**: Flow instances are **not guaranteed thread-safe**. However,
  /// the `@Temporal` constraint (see below) restricts Flow usage to callback scope,
  /// which naturally prevents concurrent access and sharing across threads.
  ///
  /// ## Temporal Constraint
  ///
  /// **CRITICAL**: Flow instances are temporal objects with **callback-scoped lifetime**.
  /// They are provided to configuration callbacks and **MUST only be accessed during
  /// callback execution**. Using a Flow instance after its callback returns results in
  /// undefined behavior.
  ///
  /// **VALID usage** - Flow used only within callback scope:
  ///
  /// **INVALID usage** - Flow stored or escaped from callback:
  ///
  /// **Why this matters**: The Flow interface serves as a **configuration builder** during
  /// pipe construction. The implementation may reuse Flow instances across multiple callbacks
  /// (object pooling), or may become invalid after materialization into the actual pipe chain.
  /// Storing Flow references breaks these implementation optimizations and leads to subtle bugs.
  ///
  /// **Design intent**: This temporal constraint enables:
  /// - **Object pooling** - Flow builders can be pooled and reused for reduced allocation
  /// - **Clear lifecycle** - Separation between configuration phase and execution phase
  /// - **Thread safety** - Callback scope prevents sharing across threads (no concurrent access)
  /// - **Mutable optimization** - Implementations can use mutable builders without synchronization
  /// - **Compile-time contract** - The `@Temporal` annotation documents lifecycle at the type level
  ///
  /// By restricting Flow to callback scope, the temporal constraint **solves the sharing problem**:
  /// you cannot accidentally share a Flow across threads because you cannot store or escape it
  /// from the callback. This allows implementations to use efficient mutable builders without
  /// any thread-safety concerns.
  ///
  /// Flow instances provided to `Channel.pipe(Consumer)` callbacks, `Circuit.conduit(..., Consumer)`
  /// callbacks, and similar configuration methods are **all subject to this constraint**.

  ///
  /// ## Percept Hierarchy
  ///
  /// The substrate defines percepts at different abstraction levels:

  /// - **{@link Pipe}**: Primitive percept providing raw emission capability
  /// - **Serventis Instruments**: Semantic percepts providing domain-specific emission
  ///
  /// ## Design Rationale
  ///
  /// This marker interface establishes "emittability" as a first-class substrate concept.
  /// By marking both primitive pipes and higher-level instruments as percepts, the
  /// architecture makes explicit what can produce observable events, enabling generic
  /// tooling, meta-observability, and compositional patterns while maintaining zero
  /// performance overhead.
  ///
  /// ## Primitive vs Semantic Percepts
  ///
  /// - **Primitive Percept** ({@link Pipe}): Type-parameterized emission of any value
  /// - **Semantic Percepts** (Instruments): Domain-specific facades that emit semantic signs/signals
  ///
  /// Both share the fundamental capability: emitting observations into the substrate.

  /// A consumer abstraction for receiving typed emissions in a data flow pipeline.
  ///
  /// Pipe is the fundamental building block for processing values as they flow through
  /// the substrate system. Pipes consume emissions via [#emit(Object)] and can be composed,
  /// transformed, registered with channels, and dispatched through circuits.
  ///
  /// ## Creating Pipes
  ///
  /// Pipes are created exclusively through framework-provided factory methods:
  ///
  /// - [Cortex#pipe(Receptor)] - Creates a pipe from a receptor
  /// - [Cortex#pipe(Class, Receptor)] - Creates a pipe with explicit type information
  /// - [Cortex#pipe(Function, Pipe)] - Creates a transformation pipe
  /// - [Channel#pipe()] - Obtains the channel's pipe for direct emission
  /// - [Circuit#pipe(Pipe, Consumer)] - Wraps a pipe with flow operations
  ///
  /// **User code should not implement this interface directly.** All Pipe implementations
  /// are controlled by the framework, which enables future optimizations like sealed types
  /// and monomorphic call sites.
  ///
  /// ## Threading Model
  ///
  /// Pipes have **no inherent threading contract** - execution context depends on the source:
  ///
  /// - **Direct pipes**: Execute on caller's thread (synchronous)
  /// - **Circuit-dispatched pipes**: Execute on circuit thread (async enqueue/dequeue)
  /// - **Channel pipes**: Route through flow, then dispatch to circuit thread
  /// - **Registered pipes**: Execute on circuit thread when channel emits
  ///
  /// ## Performance
  ///
  /// Pipe emission is a **critical hot-path operation**. For high throughput:
  /// - Minimize allocations in `emit()` implementations
  /// - Use [Cortex#pipe(Function, Pipe)] to shift work from circuit thread to caller thread
  /// - Avoid I/O or blocking in hot pipes
  /// - Keep `emit()` logic simple and allocation-free
  ///
  /// The circuit thread is the bottleneck (single-threaded, processes all events sequentially).
  /// Balance work between caller threads (before enqueue) and circuit thread (after dequeue).
  ///
  /// ## Composition and Transformation
  ///
  /// Pipes support functional composition via [Cortex#pipe(Function, Pipe)]:
  ///
  /// Composition enables:
  /// - Type conversions between pipeline stages
  /// - Transformation chains via nested cortex.pipe() calls
  /// - Shifting work to caller thread (performance optimization)
  ///
  /// ## Null Handling Contract
  ///
  /// The `@NotNull` annotation on [#emit(Object)] indicates:
  /// - Callers must not pass `null` to `emit()`
  /// - Implementations may assume emissions are non-null
  /// - Passing `null` may throw [NullPointerException] (implementation-dependent)
  ///
  /// For pipelines requiring null-safety, implementations may wrap pipes with guards
  /// that validate emissions before dispatch.
  ///
  /// ## Synchronization Contract
  ///
  /// Pipes themselves provide **no thread-safety guarantees**:
  /// - Implementations are not required to be thread-safe
  /// - Concurrent calls to `emit()` from multiple threads may require external synchronization
  /// - Circuit-dispatched and registered pipes avoid this problem - they execute exclusively
  ///   on the circuit thread, eliminating concurrent access
  ///
  /// For direct pipes called from multiple threads, use external synchronization or
  /// circuit-dispatch to serialize access.
  ///
  /// ## Lifecycle
  ///
  /// Pipes have no explicit lifecycle or cleanup:
  /// - No `close()` or `dispose()` methods
  /// - Lifetime managed by owning context (channel, subscription, circuit)
  /// - Registered pipes become inactive when subscription closes
  /// - No resources to release for simple function-based pipes
  ///

  /// Functional interface for receiving emissions within the substrate.
  ///
  /// A receptor receives emissions and processes them, typically as part of a pipe
  /// or subscription callback. This interface provides a domain-specific alternative
  /// to [java.util.function.Consumer] for emission reception, offering clearer
  /// semantics and avoiding IDE contract warnings when used in neural circuitry contexts.
  ///
  /// ## Purpose
  ///
  /// Receptors serve as the fundamental callback mechanism for emission processing:
  ///
  /// - **Pipe creation**: Wrap receptors as pipes via [Cortex#pipe(Receptor)]
  /// - **Registration**: Register receptors with channels via [Registrar#register(Receptor)]
  /// - **Value processing**: Transform, filter, aggregate, or side effect on emissions
  ///
  /// ## Receptor vs Consumer
  ///
  /// While functionally equivalent to [java.util.function.Consumer], [Receptor] provides:
  ///
  /// - **Semantic clarity**: "receive" is domain-appropriate for signal reception in neural circuitry
  /// - **Contract independence**: Avoids inheriting Consumer's general-purpose contract expectations
  /// - **IDE-friendly**: Custom interface works better with annotations and tooling
  /// - **Architectural consistency**: Pairs with [Percept] - percepts emit, receptors receive
  ///
  /// ## Usage Patterns
  ///
  ///
  /// ## Thread Safety
  ///
  /// Receptors invoked via pipes or registrations execute on the circuit's processing thread,
  /// providing single-threaded guarantees. Receptors can safely use mutable state,
  /// access shared data structures, and perform stateful operations without
  /// synchronization.
  ///
  /// ## Null Handling
  ///
  /// Receptors should generally not receive null emissions, as the substrate framework
  /// validates emissions at pipe entry points. However, receptors should handle null
  /// gracefully if defensive programming is desired.
  ///
  /// @param <E> the type of emission to receive

    /// registered pipes or circuit-dispatched pipes.
    ///
    /// ## Execution Context
    ///
    /// - **Thread**: Circuit's processing thread (for registered/dispatched receptors)
    /// - **Timing**: Synchronous within emission processing
    /// - **Ordering**: Deterministic with respect to other emissions and circuit events

    /// - Stateful operations are safe (single-threaded execution on circuit thread)

  /// A temporary registration handle for attaching pipes to a channel during subscription.
  ///
  /// Registrar instances are provided to subscriber callbacks

  /// channel identified by the subject.
  ///
  /// ## Temporal Validity
  ///
  /// **CRITICAL**: Registrar instances are **only valid during the
  /// subscriber callback** in which they were provided.
  ///
  /// - **Valid**: Inside the `(subject, registrar) -> {...}` callback body
  /// - **Invalid**: After the callback returns to the framework
  /// - **Invalid**: If stored and called later (asynchronously)
  ///
  /// Calling [#register(Pipe)] after the callback returns results in **undefined behavior**.
  /// The registrar may throw exceptions, silently fail, or register to the wrong channel.
  ///
  /// ## Registration Semantics
  ///
  /// Each call to [#register(Pipe)] adds a pipe to the channel's emission list:
  /// - Multiple pipes can be registered for the same channel
  /// - All registered pipes receive every emission (fan-out)
  /// - Registration order determines pipe invocation order
  /// - Pipes are invoked sequentially on the circuit's processing thread
  ///
  /// ## Execution Model
  ///
  /// All registered pipes execute on the circuit's processing thread:
  /// - Deterministic ordering with circuit events
  /// - Sequential execution (no concurrent pipe invocation)
  /// - No synchronization needed in pipe logic
  /// - Emissions occur in circuit's queue order
  ///
  /// ## Lifecycle
  ///
  /// Registered pipes remain active until:
  /// - The owning [Subscription] is closed
  /// - The channel's source is closed
  /// - The owning circuit is closed
  ///
  /// When a subscription is closed, the source lazily removes the registered pipes
  /// from each channel on the channel's next emission (lazy rebuild).
  ///
  /// ## Usage Pattern
  ///
  /// ## Multiple Registrations
  ///
  /// The same pipe instance can be registered multiple times:
  /// - Each registration creates an independent callback
  /// - The pipe's `emit()` is called once per registration per emission
  /// - Useful for weighted voting or sampling patterns
  ///
  /// ## Performance Considerations
  ///
  /// Registration is **not** a hot-path operation:
  /// - Occurs only during subscription and channel creation
  /// - Can involve list allocations and coordination
  /// - Not optimized for high-frequency calls
  ///
  /// In contrast, pipe emission (via `pipe.emit()`) **is** hot-path and highly optimized.

  ///
  /// The [#close()] method is marked `@Idempotent`:
  /// - First call performs cleanup and releases resources
  /// - Subsequent calls have no effect (safe no-op)
  /// - No exceptions thrown on repeated close
  /// - State transitions: Active → Closed (terminal)
  ///
  /// This idempotency contract enables safe usage patterns:
  ///
  /// ## Not [AutoCloseable]
  ///
  /// Resource does NOT extend AutoCloseable because:
  /// - Most resources have indefinite lifetimes (circuit runs until shutdown)
  /// - Try-with-resources implies short-lived scoped usage
  /// - Exceptions on close would complicate circuit shutdown
  ///
  /// For scoped resource management, use [Scope] which provides ARM semantics.
  ///
  /// ## Default Implementation
  ///
  /// The default `close()` is a no-op, allowing types without cleanup needs to
  /// implement Resource without boilerplate. Concrete implementations override when
  /// actual cleanup is required.
  ///
  /// ## Thread Safety
  ///
  /// Resource implementations must make `close()` thread-safe:
  /// - Can be called from any thread
  /// - Concurrent calls must be safe (idempotency helps)
  /// - Typically uses atomic state transitions
  ///
  /// Example from Circuit:
  /// - Close can be called from any thread
  /// - Processing thread checks closed state and terminates
  /// - Safe concurrent access to close flag
  ///
  /// ## Lifecycle Guarantees
  ///
  /// After `close()` returns:
  /// - No new operations accepted (may throw [IllegalStateException])
  /// - Background operations terminated or marked for termination
  /// - System resources released (threads, timers, handles)
  /// - Pending operations may complete (eventual consistency)
  ///
  /// For example, after `circuit.close()`:
  /// - New conduit/channel creation throws
  /// - Processing thread drains queue then terminates
  /// - Already-queued emissions still process
  ///

    ///
    /// Must be thread-safe - can be called concurrently from multiple threads.
    /// Implementations use atomic state or synchronization to ensure only one

    ///
    /// ## Blocking vs Non-Blocking
    ///
    /// Implementations may be:
    /// - **Non-blocking**: Marks resource for closure, returns immediately
    /// - **Blocking**: Waits for operations to complete before returning
    ///
    /// Circuit close is typically non-blocking - marks closed, processing thread

  ///
  /// ## Closure vs Register
  ///
  /// Two lifecycle management patterns:
  ///
  /// **[#register(Resource)]** - Scope-scoped:
  /// - Resource lives for entire scope duration
  /// - Closed when scope closes
  /// - Use for long-lived resources within scope
  ///
  /// **[#closure(Resource)]** - Block-scoped:
  /// - Resource lives only during [Closure#consume(Consumer)] call
  /// - Closed when block exits
  /// - Use for short-lived, localized resource usage
  ///
  /// ## Thread Safety
  ///
  /// Operations must be confined to a single thread:
  /// - **Not thread-safe** - implementations are not required to support concurrent access
  /// - Typical usage: single thread with try-with-resources
  /// - Closing from multiple threads may result in undefined behavior
  ///
  /// ## Error Handling
  ///
  /// If resource close throws during scope close:
  /// - Exception is suppressed
  /// - Remaining resources still closed
  /// - Follows AutoCloseable conventions
  ///
  /// All registered resources are closed even if some fail.
  ///
  /// ## Use Cases
  ///
  /// Scopes excel at:
  /// - **Structured concurrency**: Circuit per request, auto-cleanup
  /// - **Test fixtures**: Setup/teardown resources automatically
  /// - **Resource grouping**: Batch multiple resources for coordinated lifecycle
  /// - **Hierarchical cleanup**: Parent-child resource relationships
  /// - **Exception safety**: Guaranteed cleanup even on exceptions

  /// An interface for subscribing to source events.
  ///
  /// The fundamental abstraction for event-emitting components with identity.
  ///
  /// Source combines two essential capabilities:
  ///
  /// - **Substrate**: Every source has a unique [Subject] providing identity,
  ///       hierarchical naming, and associated state
  /// - **Subscription**: Sources can be subscribed to, enabling dynamic discovery of
  ///       channels and adaptive topology construction
  ///
  /// Source is implemented by Circuit, Conduit, and Cell.
  ///
  /// ## Subscription Lifecycle
  ///
  /// When a [Subscriber] is registered with a source, the subscriber receives callbacks lazily
  /// when channels receive their first emission after the subscription is registered. Each callback
  /// supplies a [Registrar] that the subscriber can use to attach or detach pipes.
  ///
  /// ## Dynamic Subscription Model
  ///
  /// Sources enable **dynamic discovery** of channels:
  /// 1. Subscriber calls [#subscribe(Subscriber)] to register interest
  /// 2. Source creates channels lazily as they're accessed (e.g., via [Lookup#percept(Name)])
  /// 3. When a channel receives its first emission, rebuild is triggered
  /// 4. During rebuild, source invokes the subscriber callback for newly encountered channels
  /// 5. Subscriber registers pipes via [Registrar#register(Pipe)] during the callback
  /// 6. Registered pipes receive the current emission and all subsequent emissions on that channel
  ///
  /// Subscriptions may be added or removed while emissions are in flight, and new channels
  /// may appear without halting the circuit. API implementations should ensure these
  /// operations are coordinated on the circuit thread so dispatch remains deterministic for
  /// all observers.
  ///
  /// ## Thread Safety
  ///
  /// [#subscribe(Subscriber)] can be called from any thread. The subscription is
  /// registered asynchronously on the circuit thread. Subscriber callbacks are guaranteed
  /// to execute on the circuit thread, ensuring deterministic ordering and eliminating
  /// the need for synchronization within subscriber logic.
  ///
  /// ## Lazy Rebuild Synchronization
  ///
  /// Sources use a **lazy rebuild** mechanism to synchronize subscription changes:
  /// - When subscriptions are added or removed, a version counter is incremented
  /// - Channels detect version changes on their next emission
  /// - Channels rebuild their pipe lists only when needed (lazy evaluation)
  /// - This avoids blocking emissions during subscription changes
  ///
  /// **Eventual consistency**: Subscription changes are not immediately visible to
  /// all channels. Each channel discovers the change on its next emission and rebuilds
  /// its pipe list. This provides lock-free operation and minimal coordination overhead.
  ///
  /// ## Core Implementations
  ///
  /// Concrete types that implement Source:
  ///
  /// - **[Circuit]**: The central processing engine managing event flow with ordering
  ///       guarantees. Emits [State] values representing circuit lifecycle and status.
  /// - **[Conduit]**: Pooled percept factory that emits events and manages channel lifecycle.
  /// - **[Cell]**: Combines a pipe and source for advanced data flow patterns.
  ///
  /// ## Self-Referential Typing
  ///
  /// The type parameter `S extends Source<E, S>` enables type-safe subject extraction:
  ///
  /// This pattern ensures `source.subject().type()` returns the concrete source class,
  /// enabling pattern matching and runtime type discrimination.
  ///
  /// ## Threading Model
  ///
  /// All subscriber callbacks execute on the source's associated circuit processing thread:
  /// - Subscriber callbacks are invoked on the circuit thread
  /// - Deterministic ordering with other circuit events
  /// - No synchronization needed in subscriber logic
  /// - Subscription registration and unregistration are thread-safe
  ///
  /// Multiple threads may call [#subscribe(Subscriber)] concurrently. The source
  /// coordinates subscription changes via the circuit's event queue, ensuring thread-safe
  /// access to internal subscription lists.
  ///
  /// ## Lifecycle
  ///
  /// A subscription progresses through these states:
  /// 1. **Registered**: [#subscribe(Subscriber)] returns [Subscription]
  /// 2. **Active**: Subscriber receives callbacks for newly created channels
  /// 3. **Closed**: After [Subscription#close()], no more callbacks occur
  ///
  /// Subscriptions remain active until explicitly closed or the source is closed.
  ///
  /// ## Ordering Guarantees
  ///
  /// - Subscriber callbacks occur in channel creation order
  /// - All callbacks for a single subscription are serialized (circuit thread execution)
  /// - Multiple subscribers receive callbacks in registration order
  /// - Emissions to registered pipes follow circuit's deterministic ordering
  ///
  /// ## Use Cases
  ///
  /// Sources excel at:
  /// - **Auto-wiring**: Automatically attach observers to all channels
  /// - **Instrumentation**: Monitor all emission points without explicit wiring
  /// - **Dynamic topologies**: Build networks that adapt to runtime structure
  /// - **Telemetry**: Capture emissions from channels discovered at runtime

    ///

    /// - **Lazy callback invocation**: Subscriber callbacks are invoked lazily during rebuild,

  /// Connects outlet pipes with emitting subjects within a source.
  ///
  /// Subscriber is a runtime-provided type that invokes user-supplied callbacks when new
  /// channels are created in a [Source]. Users create subscribers via [Cortex#subscriber]
  /// factory methods, providing a [BiConsumer] callback that receives a [Subject] identifying
  /// the channel and a [Registrar] for attaching [Pipe]s to receive emissions.
  ///
  /// ## Dynamic Discovery Model
  ///
  /// Subscribers enable **dynamic wiring** of pipes to channels:
  /// 1. Create a subscriber via [Cortex#subscriber(Name, BiConsumer)] with your callback
  /// 2. Subscribe to a source via [Source#subscribe(Subscriber)]
  /// 3. When channels are created, your callback is invoked with subject and registrar
  /// 4. Register pipes via [Registrar#register(Pipe)] during the callback
  /// 5. Registered pipes receive all future emissions from that channel
  ///
  /// This allows building adaptive topologies that respond to runtime structure without
  /// prior knowledge of channel names.
  ///
  /// ## Threading Model
  ///
  /// Subscriber callbacks are always executed on the circuit's processing thread,
  /// ensuring sequential processing and deterministic ordering. This means:
  ///
  /// - **Circuit-thread execution**: Your callback BiConsumer is always invoked on
  ///   the circuit's processing thread, never concurrently.
  /// - **No synchronization needed**: State touched only from the circuit thread
  ///   does not require additional synchronization. The circuit thread is the sole
  ///   accessor of circuit-confined state.
  /// - **Sequential invocations**: All subscriber invocations for a given circuit
  ///   happen sequentially. No two callbacks execute concurrently.
  /// - **No interruption**: The callback cannot be interrupted or executed concurrently
  ///   by multiple threads.
  /// - **External coordination**: Coordination with other threads must still be handled
  ///   explicitly by callers (e.g., via [Circuit#await()]).
  ///
  /// ## Callback Timing and Contract
  ///
  /// **When callbacks occur**:
  ///
  /// - **Lazy callback invocation**: Subscriber callbacks are invoked lazily during pipeline rebuild,
  ///   which occurs on the first emission to a channel after the subscription is registered.
  /// - **Channel creation vs. emission**: Creating a channel (e.g., via [Lookup#percept(Name)])
  ///   does NOT invoke callbacks; callbacks fire when the channel receives its first emission.
  /// - **Implementation note**: The current SPI rebuilds pipelines lazily on emission,
  ///   invoking subscriber callbacks for newly encountered channels during the rebuild phase.
  /// - **Sequential ordering**: All callbacks occur sequentially on the circuit thread.
  ///
  /// **Callback guarantee**: For each channel that receives an emission while a subscription
  /// is active, your callback BiConsumer is invoked exactly once (during the first emission
  /// after subscription) to register pipes for that channel.
  ///
  /// ## Registrar Temporal Contract
  ///
  /// The [Registrar] parameter is **only valid during your callback**:
  ///
  /// Calling `registrar.register()` after your callback returns results in undefined behavior.
  /// This temporal restriction allows efficient registrar implementation without
  /// synchronization overhead.
  ///
  /// ## Subject Inspection
  ///
  /// The [Subject] parameter provides:
  /// - **Identity**: Unique [Subject#id()] for this channel
  /// - **Name**: Hierarchical [Subject#name()] identifying the channel
  /// - **State**: Associated [Subject#state()] metadata
  /// - **Type**: [Subject#type()] for pattern matching (always `Channel.class`)
  ///
  /// Use the subject to make decisions about which pipes to register:
  ///
  /// ## Implementation Guidelines
  ///
  /// **Keep callbacks short**:
  /// - Callbacks execute on the circuit's processing thread (the bottleneck)
  /// - Avoid expensive computations or I/O in your callback
  /// - Simple pipe registration should be ~nanoseconds
  /// - Complex initialization should happen asynchronously
  ///
  /// **State management**:
  /// - Your callback can capture variables from the enclosing scope
  /// - No synchronization needed for state accessed only from the callback
  /// - For shared state with other threads, use external synchronization
  ///
  /// **Error handling**:
  /// - Exceptions thrown from your callback propagate to the circuit
  /// - Circuit may terminate or handle errors per implementation
  /// - Prefer defensive programming (validate subject, catch exceptions)
  ///
  /// ## Use Cases
  ///
  /// Subscribers excel at:
  /// - **Instrumentation**: Auto-attach metrics/logging to all channels
  /// - **Dynamic routing**: Route emissions based on channel names/metadata
  /// - **Topology discovery**: Build views of runtime structure
  /// - **Testing**: Capture all emissions for validation
  ///
  /// ## Resource Lifecycle
  ///
  /// Subscriber extends [Resource], enabling try-with-resources for automatic cleanup:
  ///
  /// Calling [Resource#close()] on a subscriber will unsubscribe from all sources.
  /// The current implementation provides a no-op close() - full subscription tracking
  /// will be added in a future release.

  /// @see Source
  /// @see Source#subscribe(Subscriber)
  /// @see Subject
  /// @see Registrar
  /// @see Pipe

  /// A cancellable handle representing an active subscription to a source.
  ///
  /// Subscription is returned by [Source#subscribe(Subscriber)] and allows
  /// the subscriber to cancel interest in future events. Each subscription has its
  /// own identity (via [Substrate]) and can be closed to unregister.
  ///
  /// ## Lifecycle
  ///
  /// A subscription progresses through these states:
  /// 1. **Active**: Created by `subscribe()`, subscriber receives callbacks
  /// 2. **Closed**: After `close()` is called, no more callbacks occur
  ///
  /// Subscriptions remain active until explicitly closed or the source itself is closed.
  ///
  /// ## Cancellation Semantics
  ///
  /// Calling [Resource#close()] on a subscription:
  /// - Unregisters the subscriber from the source
  /// - Stops all future subscriber callbacks
  /// - Removes all pipes registered by this subscriber from active channels
  /// - Is **idempotent** - repeated calls are safe and have no effect
  ///
  /// ## Threading
  ///
  /// Subscriptions can be closed from any thread:
  /// - Thread-safe for concurrent close() calls
  /// - May be closed from within subscriber callbacks
  /// - May be closed from external threads
  ///
  /// The unregistration happens asynchronously on the circuit's processing thread,
  /// ensuring deterministic removal without blocking the caller.
  ///
  /// ## Timing Considerations
  ///
  /// After calling `close()`:
  /// - The unsubscription is coordinated asynchronously on the circuit thread
  /// - Already-queued callbacks may still execute (circuit-thread delivery)
  /// - No NEW channels will trigger callbacks after unsubscription completes
  /// - Pipes registered before close() continue receiving emissions until rebuild
  /// - Next emission on each channel triggers lazy rebuild, removing the pipes
  ///
  /// This provides "eventual consistency" - the circuit processes the unsubscription
  /// in sequence with other events. The unsubscription is not immediately visible to
  /// all channels - it becomes visible when each channel next emits (lazy rebuild).
  ///
  /// **Lazy unsubscription**: Like subscription, unsubscription uses lazy rebuild.
  /// Channels detect the unsubscription on their next emission and rebuild their
  /// pipe lists to exclude the unsubscribed pipes. This avoids global coordination
  /// and blocking.
  ///
  /// ## Resubscription
  ///
  /// After closing a subscription, the same subscriber can be resubscribed to the
  /// same or different sources. Each call to `subscribe()` creates a new,
  /// independent subscription instance.
  ///
  /// ## Usage Pattern
  ///
  /// ## [Scope] Management
  ///
  /// Subscriptions can be managed via Scope for automatic cleanup:
  ///
  /// @see Source#subscribe(Subscriber)
  /// @see Subscriber
  /// @see Resource#close()
  /// @see Scope
