/// # Serventis API
///
/// The `Serventis` API provides common abstractions for all signal-based observability
/// interfaces in the Serventis framework. It defines the structural pattern that all
/// signal types follow: a composition of Sign × Dimension.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// This API establishes a uniform protocol for signal-based communication across all
/// Serventis observability instruments. By providing common interfaces, it enables:
///
/// - Polymorphic handling of signals from different APIs
/// - Generic utilities that work across all signal types
/// - Consistent structural patterns across the framework
/// - Type-safe composition of signs and dimensions
///
/// ## Core Abstractions
///
/// - **Signal**: A composition of Sign and Dimension representing an observable event
/// - **Sign**: The primary semantic classification of what is being observed
/// - **Dimension**: The secondary qualifier providing perspective, confidence, or directionality
///
/// ## Design Pattern
///
/// All Serventis APIs that emit signals follow this structural pattern:
///
/// ```
/// Signal = Sign × Dimension
/// ```
///
/// Where each API defines domain-specific enums for Sign and Dimension that implement
/// the common interfaces defined here.
///
/// ## Example Implementations
///
/// - **Probes**: Sign (CONNECT, TRANSMIT, etc.) × Dimension (RELEASE, RECEIPT)
/// - **Services**: Sign (START, CALL, SUCCESS, etc.) × Dimension (RELEASE, RECEIPT)
/// - **Agents**: Sign (OFFER, PROMISE, FULFILL, etc.) × Dimension (PROMISER, PROMISEE)
/// - **Monitors**: Sign (STABLE, DEGRADED, etc.) × Dimension (TENTATIVE, MEASURED, CONFIRMED)
///
/// ## Benefits
///
/// 1. **Architectural Consistency**: All signal-based APIs share the same structure
/// 2. **Code Reuse**: Generic utilities can process any signal type
/// 3. **Type Safety**: Each API maintains its own strongly-typed enums
/// 4. **Extensibility**: New signal-based APIs can easily adopt this pattern
/// 5. **Clarity**: The structural pattern is explicit and self-documenting
