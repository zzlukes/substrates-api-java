/// # Actors API
///
/// The `Actors` API provides a structured framework for observing speech acts
/// performed by actors within conversational coordination. Grounded in **Speech Act
/// Theory** (Austin, Searle), this API captures communicative acts as they occur in
/// dialogue between humans and machines - whether person-to-person, person-to-AI,
/// AI-to-AI, or any combination.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// Actors - human or machine - coordinate through conversation. This API enables
/// observation of **speech acts**: the communicative actions actors perform through
/// utterances. When you ask a question, make a request, deliver work, or acknowledge
/// understanding, you're performing a speech act. This API makes those acts observable,
/// enabling reasoning about conversational patterns, coordination effectiveness, and
/// dialogue quality.
///
/// ## Important: Reporting vs Implementation
///
/// This API is for **reporting speech acts**, not implementing actors.
/// When an actor (human or AI) performs a communicative act - asks a question,
/// makes a claim, delivers work - use this API to emit observability signs about
/// those acts. Meta-level observers can then reason about dialogue patterns,
/// coordination effectiveness, and conversational dynamics.
///
/// **Example**: In a human-AI collaboration where a person requests an API design
/// and the AI delivers it, both parties emit signs: the human `request()`, the AI
/// `acknowledge()`, then `promise()`, then `deliver()`. Observers track this arc
/// to measure collaboration effectiveness.
///
/// ## Key Concepts
///
/// - **Actor**: Any entity (human or machine) that performs speech acts
/// - **Speech Act**: A communicative action with illocutionary force
/// - **Sign**: The type of speech act being performed
/// - **Dialogue**: Sequences of speech acts between coordinating actors
///
/// ## Conversational Coordination
///
/// Actors coordinate through structured dialogues - sequences of speech acts:
///
/// ### Question-Answer Pattern
/// ```
/// Human -> ASK("What APIs should we create?")
/// AI -> EXPLAIN(computational constructs analysis)
/// AI -> AFFIRM(Transactions are fundamental)
/// Human -> ACKNOWLEDGE
/// ```
///
/// ### Request-Delivery Pattern
/// ```
/// Human -> REQUEST(write Cache API)
/// AI -> ACKNOWLEDGE
/// AI -> PROMISE(will deliver)
/// AI -> DELIVER(presents Cache API)
/// Human -> ACKNOWLEDGE
/// ```
///
/// ### Correction-Clarification Pattern
/// ```
/// AI -> AFFIRM(units enable aggregation)
/// Human -> DENY(no units needed)
/// AI -> CLARIFY(so pure signs only?)
/// Human -> ACKNOWLEDGE
/// ```
///
/// ### Collaborative Refinement Pattern
/// ```
/// Human -> REQUEST(design feature)
/// AI -> EXPLAIN(initial approach)
/// Human -> DENY(different direction needed)
/// Human -> CLARIFY(specific requirements)
/// AI -> ACKNOWLEDGE
/// AI -> DELIVER(refined design)
/// Human -> ACKNOWLEDGE
/// ```
///
/// ## Signs and Semantics
///
/// ### Questions & Inquiry (1)
///
/// | Sign        | Description                                               |
/// |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
/// | `ASK`       | Seeking information, clarification, or guidance           |
///
/// ASK initiates information exchange. An actor asks when they need knowledge,
/// clarification, or input from another actor. Questions drive dialogue forward
/// and signal knowledge gaps that others can address.
///
/// ### Assertions & Explanations (3)
///
/// | Sign        | Description                                               |
/// |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
/// | `AFFIRM`    | Making a claim or judgment with confidence                |
/// | `EXPLAIN`   | Providing reasoning, elaboration, or rationale            |
/// | `REPORT`    | Conveying factual observations or findings                |
///
/// These signs convey information with different epistemological stances:
/// - **AFFIRM**: Strong commitment to truth of proposition
/// - **EXPLAIN**: Providing understanding through reasoning
/// - **REPORT**: Neutral conveyance of facts or observations
///
/// EXPLAIN is particularly important in human-AI dialogue, where reasoning
/// transparency enables trust and learning.
///
/// ### Coordination (3)
///
/// | Sign          | Description                                               |
/// |---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
/// | `REQUEST`     | Asking another actor to perform action (peer-level)       |
/// | `COMMAND`     | Directing another actor to act (authority-level)          |
/// | `ACKNOWLEDGE` | Confirming receipt, understanding, or agreement           |
///
/// These signs manage coordination flow:
/// - **REQUEST**: Initiates coordination without presuming authority
/// - **COMMAND**: Directs action with authority (manager to employee, user to system)
/// - **ACKNOWLEDGE**: Closes communication loops, confirms understanding
///
/// ACKNOWLEDGE is critical - without it, speakers don't know if they were heard.
///
/// ### Disagreement & Refinement (2)
///
/// | Sign        | Description                                               |
/// |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
/// | `DENY`      | Disagreeing with or correcting a proposition              |
/// | `CLARIFY`   | Refining, specifying, or disambiguating intent            |
///
/// Dialogue requires negotiation:
/// - **DENY**: Signals disagreement, initiates negotiation or correction
/// - **CLARIFY**: Refines understanding, resolves ambiguity
///
/// These enable course correction and convergence toward shared understanding.
///
/// ### Commitment & Delivery (2)
///
/// | Sign        | Description                                               |
/// |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
/// | `PROMISE`   | Committing to perform future action or deliver work       |
/// | `DELIVER`   | Presenting completed work or fulfilled commitment         |
///
/// The commitment arc is fundamental to collaboration:
/// - **PROMISE**: Creates obligation, enables coordination around future work
/// - **DELIVER**: Fulfills commitment, presents artifact or outcome
///
/// Tracking PROMISE → DELIVER enables measurement of commitment fulfillment,
/// a key metric for actor reliability.
///
/// ## Human-AI Dialogue Example
///
/// A typical interaction between human and AI demonstrates the full sign vocabulary:
///
/// ```
/// Human:  ASK("What about packet networks?")
/// AI:     EXPLAIN(network semantic spaces)
/// AI:     AFFIRM(Routers API would be valuable)
/// Human:  ACKNOWLEDGE
///
/// Human:  REQUEST(write Routers API)
/// AI:     ACKNOWLEDGE
/// AI:     PROMISE(will deliver)
/// AI:     DELIVER(presents Routers.java)
/// Human:  ACKNOWLEDGE
///
/// Human:  DENY(Router not right term)
/// Human:  ASK(is Actor better?)
/// AI:     EXPLAIN(terminology analysis)
/// AI:     AFFIRM(Actor is preferable)
/// Human:  ACKNOWLEDGE
///
/// Human:  COMMAND(rewrite with Actor)
/// AI:     ACKNOWLEDGE
/// AI:     CLARIFY(same 11 signs?)
/// Human:  ACKNOWLEDGE
/// AI:     DELIVER(revised Actors API)
/// ```
///
/// Observers tracking this dialogue can measure:
/// - Question response latency (ASK → EXPLAIN/AFFIRM)
/// - Commitment fulfillment (PROMISE → DELIVER)
/// - Correction cycles (DENY → CLARIFY → ACKNOWLEDGE)
/// - Overall coordination efficiency
///
/// ## Relationship to Other APIs
///
/// `Actors` signs inform ecosystem-level observability:
///
/// - **Monitors API**: Actors AFFIRM monitor conditions about system state
/// - **Counters, Gauges, Caches**: Actors REPORT observations from instruments
/// - **Routers, Resources**: Actors REQUEST actions on system components
/// - Meta-percepts observe dialogue patterns to detect coordination failures,
///   communication breakdowns, unfulfilled commitments, and conversational quality
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```java
/// final var cortex = Substrates.cortex();
/// var human = circuit.conduit(Actors::composer).percept(cortex.name("user.william"));
/// var ai = circuit.conduit(Actors::composer).percept(cortex.name("assistant.claude"));
///
/// // Human initiates collaboration
/// human.ask();        // "How should we design this?"
///
/// // AI responds with reasoning
/// ai.explain();       // Provides analysis
/// ai.affirm();        // Makes recommendation
///
/// // Human requests work
/// human.request();    // "Please implement that"
///
/// // AI commits and delivers
/// ai.acknowledge();   // Confirms request
/// ai.promise();       // Commits to deliver
/// // ... work happens ...
/// ai.deliver();       // Presents completed work
///
/// // Human confirms
/// human.acknowledge(); // "Perfect"
///
/// // Meta-observer analyzes:
/// // - Time from REQUEST to DELIVER (work latency)
/// // - PROMISE fulfillment rate (reliability)
/// // - Explanation clarity (communication quality)
/// ```
///
/// ## Performance Considerations
///
/// Actor speech act emissions operate at conversational timescales (seconds to minutes)
/// rather than computational timescales (microseconds). Signs flow asynchronously
/// through the circuit's event queue, adding minimal overhead. Unlike high-frequency
/// instruments (Counters, Routers at 10M-50M Hz), actor communication is lower-rate
/// but higher semantic density - each sign carries significant meaning about
/// coordination state and conversational dynamics.
///
/// Sign emissions leverage **zero-allocation enum emission** with ~10-20ns cost for
/// non-transit emits. The streamlined vocabulary (11 signs vs 24 in earlier designs)
/// reflects focus on practical conversational coordination rather than exhaustive
/// speech act taxonomy.
