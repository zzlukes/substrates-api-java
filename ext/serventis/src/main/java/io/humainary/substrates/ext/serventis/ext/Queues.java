/// # Queues API
///
/// The `Queues` API provides a structured and minimal interface for observing interactions
/// with queue-like systems. It enables systems to emit **semantic signals** representing
/// key queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and boundary violations.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// This API is designed to support **observability and reasoning** in systems that use
/// queues as flow-control or communication mechanisms. By modeling queue interactions
/// as composable signals, it enables introspection of system dynamics, pressure points,
/// and resource utilization without coupling to specific implementation details.
///
/// ## Important: Reporting vs Implementation
///
/// This API is for **reporting queue operation semantics**, not implementing queues.
/// If you have an actual queue implementation (BlockingQueue, message broker, task queue, etc.),
/// use this API to emit observability signals about operations performed on it.
/// Observer agents can then reason about throughput patterns, backpressure conditions,
/// and capacity dynamics without coupling to your implementation details.
///
/// **Example**: When your BlockingQueue successfully enqueues a task, you would call
/// `queue.enqueue()` to emit a signal. If the queue is full and rejects the operation,
/// call `queue.overflow()`. The signals enable meta-observability: observing the observability
/// instrumentation itself to understand queue behavior and system flow dynamics.
///
/// ## Key Concepts
///
/// - **Queue**: A named subject that emits signs describing operations performed against it
/// - **Sign**: An enumeration of distinct interaction types: `ENQUEUE`, `DEQUEUE`, `OVERFLOW`, `UNDERFLOW`
///
/// ## Signs and Semantics
///
/// | Sign        | Description                                               |
/// |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
/// | `ENQUEUE`   | An item was added to the queue                            |
/// | `DEQUEUE`   | An item was removed from the queue                        |
/// | `OVERFLOW`  | An `ENQUEUE` failed due to capacity                       |
/// | `UNDERFLOW` | A `DEQUEUE` failed due to emptiness                       |
///
/// ## Use Cases
///
/// - Modeling traffic flow in bounded queues or backpressure systems
/// - Instrumenting messaging systems, task queues, or pipelines
/// - Diagnosing latency and load in producer-consumer patterns
/// - Building higher-level abstractions such as buffers, schedulers, or mailboxes
///
/// ## Relationship to Other APIs
///
/// `Queues` signals can inform higher-level abstractions:
///
/// - **Resources API**: Queue capacity can be modeled as a resource with GRANT/DENY signals
/// - **Monitors API**: Queue overflow patterns may indicate DEGRADED or DIVERGING conditions
/// - **Services API**: Queue operations can trigger DELAY or REJECT service signals
///
/// ## Performance Considerations
///
/// Queue sign emissions are designed for high-frequency operation (10M-50M Hz).
/// Zero-allocation enum emission with ~10-20ns cost for non-transit emits.
/// Signs flow asynchronously through the circuit's event queue.
