/// # Reporters API
///
/// The `Reporters` API provides a structured framework for expressing situational assessments
/// of operational significance within the Serventis observability framework.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// This API enables systems to emit **interpretive judgments** about the operational urgency
/// or significance of a subject's current state. Unlike [Monitors], which report objective
/// conditions, [Reporters] communicate **how seriously** a situation should be treated by
/// responders, automation layers, or human operators.
///
/// ## Important: Reporting vs Implementation
///
/// This API is for **reporting situational significance assessments**, not implementing alerting systems.
/// If you have assessment logic that evaluates conditions and determines operational urgency
/// (incident severity classification, escalation policies, SLA evaluation, etc.), use this API
/// to emit observability signals about the situations you assess. Observer agents can then
/// reason about operational priorities, response patterns, and incident dynamics without
/// coupling to your assessment rules or alerting infrastructure.
///
/// **Example**: Your incident management system evaluates a DEGRADED condition with multiple
/// service failures. Based on business impact, it assesses this as a CRITICAL situation and
/// calls `reporter.situation(CRITICAL)`. The signals enable meta-observability: observing
/// situational assessments themselves to understand how urgency propagates and responses evolve.
///
/// ## Key Concepts
///
/// - **Reporter**: An instrument that emits situational assessments for a named subject
/// - **Sign**: A judgment of operational significance (NORMAL, WARNING, CRITICAL)
/// - **Assessment**: The interpretive layer that translates conditions into actionable priorities
///
/// ## Relationship to Other APIs
///
/// [Reporters] sits above [Monitors] in the observability hierarchy:
///
/// ```
/// Monitors (objective conditions) → Reporters (subjective assessments) → Actions/Responses
/// ```
///
/// A [Monitors.Monitor] might report a DEGRADED condition with MEASURED confidence, while a [Reporter]
/// translates this into a WARNING situation requiring attention but not immediate intervention.
///
/// ## Use Cases
///
/// - Translating monitoring data into operational priorities
/// - Implementing escalation policies based on situational severity
/// - Driving alerting systems with context-aware thresholds
/// - Coordinating human and automated response strategies

  /// and operational actions.
  ///
  /// ## Typical Mappings
  ///
  /// While context-dependent, typical mappings from [Monitors.Monitor] conditions might be:
  ///
  /// - NORMAL: Stable, Converging conditions
  /// - WARNING: Diverging, Erratic, or Degraded conditions
  /// - CRITICAL: Defective or Down conditions
  ///
  /// The actual mapping depends on system criticality, SLOs, and operational policies.

    /// The situation poses no immediate concern and requires no intervention.
    ///
    /// Normal situations indicate the subject is operating within acceptable parameters
    /// and no action is required. This is the default state for healthy systems.

    NORMAL,

    /// The situation requires attention but is not yet critical.
    ///
    /// Warning situations indicate the subject should be monitored more closely or
    /// investigated during normal business hours. Conditions are degrading but the
    /// system remains operational. Examples: elevated error rates, resource pressure,
    /// or performance degradation within tolerable bounds.

    WARNING,

    /// The situation is serious and demands prompt intervention.
    ///
    /// Critical situations indicate immediate action is required to prevent or mitigate
    /// significant service impact. The subject is in or approaching a failure state that
    /// threatens SLO compliance or user experience. Examples: service down, data loss risk,
    /// or cascading failures.

  /// A [Reporter] emits a [Sign] to express an observer's
  /// current assessment of a subject's operational urgency or significance.
  ///
  /// A Reporter interprets input from lower layers (such as Monitors)
  /// and publishes a distilled, context-aware judgment about how the
  /// current situation should be treated by responders or automation layers.
  ///
  /// ## Usage
  ///
  /// Use domain-specific methods: `reporter.normal()`, `reporter.warning()`, `reporter.critical()`
  ///
  /// Reporters provide semantic methods for reporting situational assessments.
