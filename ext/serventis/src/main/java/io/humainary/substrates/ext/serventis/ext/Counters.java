/// # Counters API
///
/// The `Counters` API provides a structured and minimal interface for observing
/// monotonically increasing numeric values in systems. It enables systems to emit
/// **semantic signals** representing counter operations and boundary conditions.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// This API is designed to support **observability and reasoning** about cumulative
/// metrics in systems. By modeling counter interactions as composable signals, it
/// enables introspection of accumulation patterns, boundary violations, and operational
/// events without coupling to specific implementation details.
///
/// ## Important: Reporting vs Implementation
///
/// This API is for **reporting counter semantics**, not implementing counters.
/// If you have an actual counter implementation (AtomicLong, database column, etc.),
/// use this API to emit observability signals about operations performed on it.
/// Observer agents can then reason about patterns, detect anomalies, and derive
/// higher-level metrics without coupling to your implementation details.
///
/// **Example**: When your code increments an AtomicLong request counter, you would
/// also call `counter.increment()` to emit a signal that observers can process.
/// The signal enables meta-observability: observing the observability instrumentation
/// itself to understand system behavior.
///
/// ## Key Concepts
///
/// - **Counter**: A named subject that emits signs describing operations performed against it
/// - **Sign**: An enumeration of distinct operation types: `INCREMENT`, `OVERFLOW`, `RESET`
///
/// ## Signs and Semantics
///
/// | Sign        | Description                                               |
/// |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
/// | `INCREMENT` | The counter increased                                     |
/// | `OVERFLOW`  | The counter exceeded its maximum and wrapped/reset        |
/// | `RESET`     | The counter was explicitly reset to zero                  |
///
/// ## Semantic Distinctions
///
/// - **INCREMENT**: Normal operational sign - expected accumulation
/// - **OVERFLOW**: Exceptional boundary sign - automatic wrap due to numeric limits
/// - **RESET**: Intentional operational sign - explicit zeroing by operator/agent
///
/// ## Use Cases
///
/// - Tracking request counts, bytes processed, events handled
/// - Monitoring cumulative system metrics over time
/// - Detecting boundary violations and numeric domain issues
/// - Building rate and velocity calculations through observer agents
///
/// ## Relationship to Other APIs
///
/// `Counters` signals can inform higher-level abstractions:
///
/// - **Monitors API**: Overflow patterns may indicate DEGRADED or ERRATIC conditions
/// - **Gauges API**: Counters represent the **monotonic subset** of gauge behavior.
///   Use Counters for metrics that never legitimately decrease (requests, bytes, events).
///   Use Gauges for bidirectional metrics (connections, queue depth, utilization).
///   Key difference: Counters only increment, while Gauges support both INCREMENT and DECREMENT.
/// - Observer agents translate counter signals into capacity, rate, or health signs
///
/// ## Performance Considerations
///
/// Counter sign emissions are designed for high-frequency operation (10M-50M Hz).
/// Zero-allocation enum emission with ~10-20ns cost for non-transit emits.
/// Signs flow asynchronously through the circuit's event queue.

    /// architectural attention (wider numeric type, reset policies, etc.).
