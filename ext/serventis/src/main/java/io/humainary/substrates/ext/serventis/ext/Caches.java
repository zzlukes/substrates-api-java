/// # Caches API
///
/// The `Caches` API provides a structured and minimal interface for observing cache
/// interactions within systems. It enables systems to emit **semantic signs** representing
/// lookup operations, hit/miss outcomes, storage operations, and removal conditions.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// This API is designed to support **observability and reasoning** about cache behavior
/// in systems. By modeling cache interactions as composable signs, it enables introspection
/// of cache effectiveness, capacity utilization, and operational patterns without coupling
/// to specific implementation details.
///
/// ## Important: Reporting vs Implementation
///
/// This API is for **reporting cache semantics**, not implementing caches.
/// If you have an actual cache implementation (Guava Cache, Caffeine, Redis, etc.),
/// use this API to emit observability signs about operations performed on it.
/// Observer agents can then reason about hit ratios, capacity pressure, and effectiveness
/// patterns without coupling to your implementation details.
///
/// **Example**: When your cache lookup succeeds, call `cache.hit()` to emit a sign.
/// When it misses, call `cache.miss()`. The signs enable meta-observability: observing
/// the observability instrumentation itself to understand cache behavior and effectiveness.
///
/// ## Key Concepts
///
/// - **Cache**: A named subject that emits signs describing operations performed against it
/// - **Sign**: An enumeration of distinct operation types representing cache lifecycle events
///
/// ## Cache Interaction Patterns
///
/// Caches exhibit a lifecycle of lookup, storage, and removal:
///
/// ```
/// Lookup Phase: LOOKUP
///       ↓
/// Outcome Phase: HIT (found) or MISS (not found)
///       ↓
/// Storage Phase: STORE (on miss or update)
///       ↓
/// Removal Phase: EVICT (automatic) or EXPIRE (TTL) or REMOVE (explicit)
/// ```
///
/// ## Signs and Semantics
///
/// | Sign        | Description                                               |
/// |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
/// | `LOOKUP`    | An attempt to retrieve an entry from the cache            |
/// | `HIT`       | A lookup succeeded - entry was found in cache             |
/// | `MISS`      | A lookup failed - entry was not found in cache            |
/// | `STORE`     | An entry was added or updated in the cache                |
/// | `EVICT`     | An entry was automatically removed due to capacity/policy |
/// | `EXPIRE`    | An entry was removed due to TTL/expiration                |
/// | `REMOVE`    | An entry was explicitly invalidated/removed               |
///
/// ## Semantic Distinctions
///
/// - **LOOKUP**: Informational sign - cache access before outcome is determined
/// - **HIT/MISS**: Outcome signs - result of cache lookup operation
/// - **STORE**: Operational sign - cache population or update
/// - **EVICT**: Automatic capacity-driven removal
/// - **EXPIRE**: Automatic time-driven removal
/// - **REMOVE**: Explicit intentional removal
///
/// ## Use Cases
///
/// - Tracking cache effectiveness through hit/miss patterns
/// - Monitoring cache capacity pressure via eviction frequency
/// - Detecting staleness issues through expiration patterns
/// - Understanding cache churn through removal and store frequency
///
/// ## Relationship to Other APIs
///
/// `Caches` signs can inform higher-level abstractions:
///
/// - **Gauges API**: Cache size can be modeled as a gauge (INCREMENT on STORE, DECREMENT on EVICT/EXPIRE/REMOVE)
/// - **Counters API**: Hit/miss totals can be tracked as monotonic counters
/// - **Monitors API**: Cache patterns may indicate DEGRADED or DIVERGING conditions
/// - Observer agents translate cache signs into effectiveness, capacity, or health signs
///
/// ## Performance Considerations
///
/// Cache sign emissions are designed for high-frequency operation (10M-50M Hz).
/// Zero-allocation enum emission with ~10-20ns cost for non-transit emits.
/// Signs flow asynchronously through the circuit's event queue.
