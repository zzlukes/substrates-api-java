/// # Monitors API
///
/// The `Monitors` API provides a framework for reporting **objective assessments** of operational
/// conditions based on signal pattern analysis. It enables systems to emit structured status reports
/// that classify a subject's operational state and the statistical confidence of that classification.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// This API enables systems to emit **factual observations** about operational conditions
/// without making subjective judgments about urgency or response priorities. Monitors report
/// **what is happening**, not how seriously it should be treated (see [Reporters] for that).
///
/// ## Important: Reporting vs Implementation
///
/// This API is for **reporting operational condition assessments**, not implementing monitoring systems.
/// If you have monitoring logic that analyzes metrics to determine operational state (statistical
/// analysis, anomaly detection, health checks, etc.), use this API to emit observability signals
/// about the conditions you assess. Observer agents can then reason about system health trends,
/// stability patterns, and operational trajectories without coupling to your analysis algorithms.
///
/// **Example**: Your monitoring agent analyzes error rates and latency metrics. When it determines
/// the system is DEGRADED with MEASURED confidence, call `monitor.emit(DEGRADED, MEASURED)`.
/// The signals enable meta-observability: observing the monitoring assessments themselves to
/// understand how operational conditions evolve and propagate through complex systems.
///
/// ## Key Concepts
///
/// - **Monitor**: An instrument that emits signal assessments for a named subject
/// - **Signal**: A pairing of operational sign with statistical confidence
/// - **Sign**: The operational state classification (7 distinct states)
/// - **Confidence**: The statistical certainty of the sign assessment
///
/// ## Operational Signs
///
/// The API defines 7 operational signs forming a state space:
///
/// | Sign         | Stability | Meaning                                           |
/// |--------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
/// | CONVERGING   | Improving | Stabilizing toward reliable operation             |
/// | STABLE       | Nominal   | Operating within expected parameters              |
/// | DIVERGING    | Degrading | Destabilizing with increasing variations          |
/// | ERRATIC      | Chaotic   | Unpredictable behavior, irregular transitions     |
/// | DEGRADED     | Impaired  | Reduced performance, elevated errors              |
/// | DEFECTIVE    | Failing   | Predominantly failed operations                   |
/// | DOWN         | Failed    | Entirely non-operational                          |
///
/// ## Relationship to Other APIs
///
/// `Monitors` sits at the foundation of the observability hierarchy:
///
/// ```
/// Raw signals → Monitors (conditions) → Reporters (situations) → Actions
/// ```
///
/// - **Probes API**: Provides raw observation data that feeds into condition analysis
/// - **Reporters API**: Consumes monitor conditions to produce situational assessments
/// - **Services API**: Service signals can inform condition classification
///
/// ## Confidence Progression
///
/// Confidence typically progresses over time as evidence accumulates:
///
/// ```
/// TENTATIVE (initial observations) → MEASURED (strong evidence) → CONFIRMED (definitive)
/// ```
///
/// This progression allows systems to react differently based on certainty—delaying
/// action for tentative assessments while responding immediately to confirmed conditions.
///
/// ## Performance Considerations
///
/// Monitor emissions are designed for high-frequency operation. Conditions are typically
/// computed from aggregated metrics rather than per-request signals, resulting in
/// moderate emission rates (1-1000 Hz typical). Emissions flow asynchronously through
/// the circuit to avoid blocking condition analysis.
