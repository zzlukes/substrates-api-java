/// # Resources API
///
/// The `Resources` API provides a structured framework for observing resource acquisition and release
/// patterns within systems. It enables emission of semantic signals that describe interactions with
/// **named resources** such as connections, semaphores, permits, locks, or any bounded capacity.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// This API enables systems to **observe** resource interactions without controlling them. Signals
/// report what is happening to or around a resource from either the **requester's perspective**
/// (requesting access) or the **provider's perspective** (granting or denying access).
///
/// ## Important: Reporting vs Implementation
///
/// This API is for **reporting resource interaction semantics**, not implementing resource managers.
/// If you have actual resource management implementations (connection pools, semaphores, rate limiters,
/// permit systems, etc.), use this API to emit observability signals about operations performed.
/// Observer agents can then reason about resource contention, utilization patterns, and capacity
/// dynamics without coupling to your resource management implementation details.
///
/// **Example**: Your connection pool attempts to acquire a connection. If no connections are
/// available, call `resource.attempt()` followed by `resource.deny()`. When a connection is
/// later released back to the pool, call `resource.release()`. The signals enable meta-observability:
/// observing resource interactions themselves to understand contention patterns and capacity planning needs.
///
/// ## Key Concepts
///
/// - **Resource**: A named entity with bounded capacity that can be requested, granted, and released
/// - **Sign**: The type of interaction (ATTEMPT, ACQUIRE, GRANT, DENY, TIMEOUT, RELEASE)
///
/// ## Resource Interaction Patterns
///
/// Resources support both **non-blocking** and **blocking** acquisition patterns:
///
/// | Pattern      | Request Sign | Success Sign | Failure Signs    | Typical Use Case          |
/// |--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------------|
/// | Non-blocking | ATTEMPT      | GRANT        | DENY             | Try-acquire, fast-fail    |
/// | Blocking     | ACQUIRE      | GRANT        | TIMEOUT          | Wait-acquire, guaranteed  |
/// | Release      | RELEASE      | -            | -                | Return units to pool      |
///
/// ## Relationship to Other APIs
///
/// `Resources` signals inform higher-level observability:
///
/// - **Queues API**: Resource pools share similar capacity/demand dynamics with bounded queues
/// - **Monitors API**: High DENY or TIMEOUT rates may indicate DEGRADED or DEFECTIVE conditions
/// - **Services API**: Resource exhaustion can trigger DELAY, REJECT, or FAIL service signals
/// - **Reporters API**: Resource pressure patterns can elevate situations from NORMAL to WARNING
///
/// ## Semantic Perspectives
///
/// Signals can be emitted from different perspectives:
///
/// - **Requester perspective**: ATTEMPT, ACQUIRE, RELEASE (what I'm doing)
/// - **Provider perspective**: GRANT, DENY, TIMEOUT (what happened to the request)
/// - **Complete story**: Emit both request and outcome for full observability
///
/// ## Performance Considerations
///
/// Resource sign emissions are designed for high-frequency operation (10M-50M Hz).
/// Zero-allocation enum emission with ~10-20ns cost for non-transit emits.
/// Signs flow asynchronously through the circuit's event queue.
