/// # Gauges API
///
/// The `Gauges` API provides a structured and minimal interface for observing
/// bidirectional numeric values in systems. It enables systems to emit **semantic signals**
/// representing gauge operations, boundary conditions, and state changes.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// This API is designed to support **observability and reasoning** about fluctuating
/// metrics in systems. By modeling gauge interactions as composable signals, it enables
/// introspection of bidirectional flows, capacity utilization, and boundary violations
/// without coupling to specific implementation details.
///
/// ## Important: Reporting vs Implementation
///
/// This API is for **reporting gauge semantics**, not implementing gauges.
/// If you have an actual gauge implementation (AtomicInteger connection pool, resource
/// tracker, etc.), use this API to emit observability signals about operations performed
/// on it. Observer agents can then reason about capacity patterns, utilization trends,
/// and boundary conditions without coupling to your implementation details.
///
/// **Example**: When your connection pool accepts a new connection, you would call
/// `gauge.increment()` to emit a signal. When a connection is released, call
/// `gauge.decrement()`. The signals enable meta-observability: observing the observability
/// instrumentation itself to understand resource utilization and capacity dynamics.
///
/// ## Key Concepts
///
/// - **Gauge**: A named subject that emits signs describing operations performed against it
/// - **Sign**: An enumeration of distinct operation types: `INCREMENT`, `DECREMENT`, `OVERFLOW`, `UNDERFLOW`, `RESET`
///
/// ## Signs and Semantics
///
/// | Sign        | Description                                               |
/// |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
/// | `INCREMENT` | The gauge increased                                       |
/// | `DECREMENT` | The gauge decreased                                       |
/// | `OVERFLOW`  | The gauge exceeded its maximum value                      |
/// | `UNDERFLOW` | The gauge fell below its minimum value                    |
/// | `RESET`     | The gauge was explicitly reset to baseline                |
///
/// ## Semantic Distinctions
///
/// - **INCREMENT/DECREMENT**: Normal operational signs - expected bidirectional changes
/// - **OVERFLOW/UNDERFLOW**: Exceptional boundary signs - capacity limit violations
/// - **RESET**: Intentional operational sign - explicit return to baseline
///
/// ## Use Cases
///
/// - Tracking active connections, queue depth, in-flight requests
/// - Monitoring resource utilization (memory, threads, file handles)
/// - Observing bidirectional flows (entry/exit patterns)
/// - Detecting capacity saturation and starvation conditions
///
/// ## Saturation vs Wrapping
///
/// Gauges can exhibit different boundary behaviors when hitting limits:
/// - **Wrapping**: Overflow/underflow causes value to wrap to opposite bound
/// - **Saturation**: Value sticks at boundary (common for resource limits)
///
/// The gauge emits the boundary signal; observer agents interpret subsequent
/// signals to determine which behavior occurred.
///
/// **Wrapping example**: A numeric gauge at max value wraps to zero on overflow
/// ```
/// gauge at MAX → increment(10) → OVERFLOW(10) → gauge wraps to 9
/// Subsequent INCREMENT signals indicate wrapping occurred
/// ```
///
/// **Saturation example**: A resource gauge at max capacity stays at max
/// ```
/// connections at MAX → increment() → OVERFLOW(1) → connections still at MAX
/// No subsequent INCREMENT signals indicate saturation
/// ```
///
/// Observer agents can detect the difference by monitoring signal patterns after boundary events.
///
/// ## Relationship to Other APIs
///
/// `Gauges` signals can inform higher-level abstractions:
///
/// - **Counters API**: Gauges provide **bidirectional** metric tracking, while Counters
///   enforce **monotonic increase**. Gauges are the superset that allows both INCREMENT
///   and DECREMENT operations. If your metric never legitimately decreases, prefer Counters
///   for semantic clarity and type safety. Key difference: Gauges allow DECREMENT and treat
///   UNDERFLOW as a boundary violation (falling below minimum) rather than an error condition.
/// - **Queues API**: Queue depth can be modeled as a gauge (INCREMENT on PUT, DECREMENT on TAKE)
/// - **Resources API**: Resource availability can be tracked via gauge operations
/// - **Monitors API**: Gauge patterns inform capacity and utilization conditions
/// - Observer agents translate gauge signals into capacity, trend, or threshold signs
///
/// ## Performance Considerations
///
/// Gauge sign emissions are designed for high-frequency operation (10M-50M Hz).
/// Zero-allocation enum emission with ~10-20ns cost for non-transit emits.
/// Signs flow asynchronously through the circuit's event queue.
